# EDLM Tuto

## Abstract

This document is meant to give a "hands-on" experience of EDLM, and hopefully outline both the
advantages of using a centralized library management system and the relative simplicity of the 
proposed solution.

While the previous proposal goes quite into details about the choices and the motives behind 
EDLM, this document is meant as a step-by-step guide, showing how to create and edit documents using EDLM.

No previous knowledge of any kind is required.
